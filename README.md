# Urban Computing Project: Multi-Step Air Pollution Forecasting

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for the project **"Multi-Step Air Pollution Forecasting: Evaluating XGBoost Strategies and Concept Drift Adaptation"**.

The project evaluates Multi-Step Output (MSO) and Repeated-Single-Output (RSO) strategies using XGBoost for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. Performance is benchmarked against traditional **ARIMA** and deep learning **LSTM** baselines. Furthermore, the study investigates the effectiveness of three concept drift adaptation strategies: **Full Refit**, **Partial Refit**, and **Retrain**.
